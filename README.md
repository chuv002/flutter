# flutter

## Installations
* First, [Flutter VSCode Plugin](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor?tab=vscode)
* Then, [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
  * use the SDK Manager in Settings to install the versions that `flutter doctor` requests.
  * also use the SDK Manager in Settings to install "Android SDK Command-line tools". [[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61993738/flutter-doctor-android-licenses-gives-a-java-error)]
* If it can't find android studio, do `flutter config --android-studio-dir="C:\YOUR-PATH-TO-THE-FOLLOWING-FOLDER\Android\Android Studio"`. This also works if you put it on a different drive.
